# Defined Type to delete a user under MySQL
# To call this defined type, you simply need source it from a profile
# or higher-scoped manifest as follows:
#
# vmyusers::delete::user { 'username':
#   dbauth   => 'dbuser',    <- Administrative user in MySQL
#   dbauthpw => 'dbauthpw',  <- Administrative user's password
#   user     => 'username',  <- User you wish to create
# }
#
# This routine runs a simple MySQL command line to add a user and give it
# general access.  This "location" parameter can be 'localhost' or '%',
# whichever is needed for your particular purposes.
#

  $dbauth,
